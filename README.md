Web Game Development final project

I am attempting to create a simple text adventure game. I plan to add a regular game as well at the end, if I have time and/or knowledge.

HOW IT WORKS
The player will go through different text options to reach the goal at the end. 
The goal of the player is to play a simple canvas game at the end.
